* Added tests for the modified Dir.glob and Dir[] behavior.
* Removed the old non-gem install Rake task.

== 0.3.6 - 6-Feb-2010
* Bug fixes for Ruby 1.9.x. Thanks go to Kendall Gifford for the spot and
  the patch.
* Minor refactoring of the Dir.create_junction method. This fixed a bug for

* Redefined the Dir.getwd (and the Dir.pwd alias) to always return a
  normalized path.
* Some gemspec updates.

== 0.3.3 - 30-Mar-2009
* Virtual folders like Dir::CONTROL, which were previously almost always nil,
  are now set to their display name.
* Fixed a bug in the create_junction method.
* Added an 'example' rake task to run the example code.
* Renamed the example program from dir_test.rb to dir_example.rb to prevent
  any potential confusion that it's a genuine test file.

* Added a Rakefile with tasks for testing and installation.
* Removed the install.rb file (the Rakefile handles installation).
* Minor updates the README, MANIFEST, and test file.

* Added the Dir.empty? method.
* Changed the Dir.reparse_dir? method to Dir.junction? (but kept an alias

* Some test tweaks and additions.

== 0.3.0 - 28-May-2006
* Now pure Ruby.
* Now has a gem.
* Added a VERSION constant.
